# ✈️ Flight Fare Predictor Project

Imagine you are a traveler on a budget, flying from one place to another. You book your flight ticket and feel like you got it at a nice price. Then, out of curiosity, you check the flight prices the next day, and the price drops to an all-time low. You start regretting your decision in booking your flight so early and wonder, wouldn't it be great to accurately predict the best time and best price to fly?

Flight prices can change due to a variety of factors. Some basic ones include:

- 🛫 **Type of airline**
- ⏰ **Time of departure and time of arrival**
- 🛑 **The number of layovers/stops**
- 🌆 **The source/destination city**

Of course, there are other factors including geopolitical, safety, and weather issues that may affect ticket prices. However, since these are out of our control, we can only focus on factors that we can choose to find the most optimal price.
